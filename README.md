# Cal-Oracle
An easy way to track your calories and stay within your caloric goal.

## Overview
Get your body swimsuit ready by using the Cal-Oracle App to set your caloric intake goals and track your progress throughout the day.
<br>
When the user opens up the application, he/she will see an input box to enter their calorie goal for the day. Once this goal is submitted, it will be displayed on the page as a reminder. The user will keep track of their calories by entering the quantity and the food item into a search bar, which will search a database for the number of calories each food item contains. The application will then display the food item and the number of calories this item contains on the list below the search bar. The list is stored on Local Storage and therefore continue to display the food items and calories until Local Storage is cleared.
<br>
As an additional feature, each time the user searches for a food item, the application will suggest a random recipe that contains that item. The listing will include a short summary of the meal, ingredients, instructions and a picture of this tasty dish.
